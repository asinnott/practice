This is a second practice file. The first time I went through the tutorial from https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners I did some play-as-you-go and made it a bit untidy. I wanted to do things a bit cleaner.

This is a line I have added while this file is on "pract_branch". I will commit the file from this branch to practice a "review and merge" step.
